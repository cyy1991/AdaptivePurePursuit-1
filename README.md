# AdaptivePurePursuit

Some basic code to test our adaptive pure pursuit for an FRC robot

Planned Tests:

Path generation/smoothing from waypoints with customizable parameters
Target velocity/decceleration calculations on those waypoints
Robot lookahead calculations and odometry
Robot simulation for testing out code

Most work is based off of this paper: https://www.chiefdelphi.com/uploads/default/original/3X/b/e/be0e06de00e07db66f97686505c3f4dde2e332dc.pdf
